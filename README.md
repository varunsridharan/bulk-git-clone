# Bulk Git Clone
This is a simple **PHP** Script which can clone all your github repo into local.

## ðŸ¤” Why ?
Well i have around 150+ repositories in personal account and 200+ in organization accounts

and i found it âŒ› consuming to clone each of them manually. 

so i created a **PHP** script which can do it for me with the help of **Github API** 

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Step 1
clone this into your local / download this repo 

### Step 2
Create a Personal Access Token with ðŸ‘‡ **Scopes**

php cloneall.php {your-personal-github-token}
```

**With Custom Location To Save Your Repositories**
```text
php cloneall.php {your-personal-github-token} /home/your-location/path/
```
